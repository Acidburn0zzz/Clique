Functionality
=============
- Modify metadata to be member of appropriate class:
  a) FactorMetadata: stay member of DistSymmInfo
  b) (Solve)Metadata1d: member of DistNodalMultiVec
  c) (Solve)Metadata2d: member of DistNodalMatrix
- Implement versions of Solve routines which supports DistNodalMatrix
- Implement faster sparse mat-vec
- Implement constructor for non-trivial DistSparseMatrix from SparseMatrix
  (and the equivalent for DistMultiVec from MultiVec)

Maintenance
===========
- Convert to header-file structure which is similar to Elemental
- Switch from current flat layout for supernodal trees into an actual (custom) 
  tree data structure?
