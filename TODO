Functionality
=============
- Implement constructor for non-trivial DistSparseMatrix from SparseMatrix
  (and the equivalent for DistMultiVec from MultiVec)

Maintenance
===========
- Find a way to avoid redundancy in local portion of Solve
- Switch from current flat layout for supernodal trees into an actual (custom) 
  tree data structure?
