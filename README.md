# Clique

A C++ sparse-direct solver for distributed-memory architectures with an 
emphasis on scalable triangular solves and memory usage.
The library was initially released as part of 
[A parallel sweeping preconditioner for heterogeneous 3D Helmholtz equations](http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/120871985) ([a preprint is available on arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.0111)) and is built directly on top of 
[Elemental](http://github.com/poulson/Elemental).
